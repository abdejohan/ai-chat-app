/*
The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant.
For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about
how it should behave throughout the conversation.
However note that the system message is optional and the modelâ€™s behavior
without a system message is likely to be similar to using a
generic message such as "You are a helpful assistant."
